- 👋 Hi, I’m @AmexZero
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, scalable applications, and backend optimization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced features in NestJS, Linux system administration, and performance tuning with Nginx.
- 💞 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving MERN/PERN stacks, Next.js, and large-scale backend systems.
- 📫 How to reach me: [abobr517@gmail.com]
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with proxy protocols like VLESS and working with open-source software!
